Notes:

v.1.0
Extension: Current version is standalone popup that takes in language and series
of words, each delimited by a single comma. Works on a single webpage, will
replace all instances of words with translation using Google Translate API.

Known Bugs:
1. Does not translate all instances, especially for certain words and DOM types
2. Will sometimes throw a server error:
The API returned an error: Error: The service is currently unavailable.
(node:11040) UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection (rejection id: 1): TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
(node:11040) DeprecationWarning: Unhandled promise rejections are deprecated. In the future, promise rejections that are not handled will terminate the Node.js process with a non-zero exit code.
Which leads to a token error with the API.
3. Is served over http, rather than https

Future Plans:
1. Build website interface
2. Integrate extension
